title: The Infinite Resource Paradigm
---

We hear a lot about sustainable food and sustainable energy these days. It's good that we are finally starting to acknowledge these things, but we're only looking at a fraction of the bigger picture. Our sustainability problems run much deeper than any of us want to truly admit.

Our entire modern culture is built upon completely unsustainable principles. 

To begin with, the way we have grown our way of life is based around a fiat currency. Our money is completely useless - you can't gain nutrition from it, and you can't run your car on it. What you can do is exchange it for things of actual use and value. There's a lot of mysticism and fear-tactics used to try and make people think that money is hard to understand. We have entire systems of schooling setup to educate us about money and our economics. There are complicated equations and policies and standards used to determine various numbers that represent our economy.

And we are taught that this works. That somehow, through complications we can't understand, our economy chugs on. We are **bred** to believe that money has value because law says it does.

But it doesn't.

And you don't have to understand any fancy numbers or equations to realize this.

We create money out of thin air every second of every day. Money that has absolutely no backing in real value. Money that is poisoning our civilized life.

Anytime you deposit money in your bank, that bank can then loan out an amount of money exponentially larger than what you actually deposited. This is all based on meticulously calculated patterns, averages, and probabilities of people actually coming to get that money out of the bank. But it doesn't matter. You can make numbers do very magical things, but in the end, numbers are just numbers, they aren't real. In basic terms, in a normal day, people are not pulling every cent out of their accounts in cash. So the banks literally create money every time anyone makes a deposit to loan out to more people.

And we do the same thing with credit cards every day. If a person holds a balance on a credit card and gets charged interest, they and the credit company have just created money out of the air that didn't exist before. The credit balance was not paid in cash, in full, and thus some amount of interest was added to the balance - and suddenly that much more money exists in our economy.

Knowing how much credit card debt the average American has (yet alone the American government...), it really becomes obvious just how much magic money we pump into our system every day. Does anyone actually believe there is 15 TRILLION dollars in existence? Yet alone 15 trillion backed by anything of real value. (That number is the US National debt, found <a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/" target ="blank">**here**</a> - it doesn't include other countries or even other private debts within America)

Are you starting to see the problem?

Our entire way of life is based off an infinite-resource model. But that is, of course, impossible. If you take any class on business, one of the first things you will learn is the life-cycle of a business. Just like people, businesses die too. First there's growth, then maturity, then decline and death. People learn that every day, but we are taught to focus on the growth portion of that cycle, because of course, everyone wants to be in growth. So we learn how to extend the growth stage as long as possible.

The bad news is, the American Government is also a business, and we are well into the decline portion of that business. The "modern" way of life has long since reached it's peak and is now headed toward demise, just like every other civilization in history.

No one wants to stop to think about the negatives during periods of growth. Make the extra money, meet the demands; it's another thing we're bred to believe in (Capitalism). But what happens when you grow? You hire more employees, you build more facilities, you expand, you buy out competitors, you buy out suppliers, pretty soon you are an empire that requires billions of dollars a day to sustain. How many days can you keep bringing in the billions needed to stay afloat? These things are ignored during growth, and in business, maybe the owners don't even care. Maybe they just want to grow it, make as much money as they can, and then get out. Unfortunately, while the owners might make fancy off of that approach, it leaves a lot of employees displaced and often destitute.

With modern life, our populations and economies exploded, just like a growing business. Between the time we entered into existence up to the 1900's, our population reached 1.6 billion people. From the 1900's to the year 2000, we grew to 6.5 billion people. (Numbers can be found <a href="http://geography.about.com/od/obtainpopulationdata/a/worldpopulation.htm" target="blank">**here**</a>)

What do you think comes next?

We all know the answer, we just don't want to believe it as truth. We have a system completely dependent on finite resources (mainly oil), and as those resources disappear and become more expensive, our way of life will grind to a halt. As our culture ceases to exist, so will our extreme population. And while alternative sources of energy are under investigation, if you actually look anywhere beyond the surface level of such things, it becomes apparent that without the resources we rely so heavily on today (again, mainly oil), none of those alternatives are even possibilities. Electric, hydrogen, even water cars don't matter if you don't have the oil to make the tires, plastic, and engines of the vehicles. Nuclear power doesn't matter if we don't have the energy and oil to manufacture the plants (one of the most energy-intensive projects man has ever created, between the construction of the facility, containment chambers, and the main component: enrichment of uranium).

You need only look to nature for reinforcement of this. Anytime a species has a massive population increase, they have a massive die-off soon after because the system can't support the population.

You can either choose to acknowledge the problem and adapt, or you can ignore it and perish with the system we all hide in.

Look for community, and work towards community. We can't make it on our own. We need each other. We need the skill-sets of many, not the arrogance and pride of one. This isn't Obama's fault, this isn't Bush's fault - this is all of our faults. It's laughable that we all want to sit back and blame the president for our issues. The president cannot solve the situation we are in. One person cannot fix this just because we all threw our problems at them to try and make them go away. Our government is an archaic, outdated system that can't even operate with itself. It's a business that has grown too big to sustain itself, and we see the consequences of that everyday. And within all that we expect a person to step into "power" and fix it all?

This is not conspiracy or paranoia, this is happening to us, RIGHT NOW. States are bankrupt, our government is bankrupt, and soon the Fed will be bankrupt too.

The infinite-resource model hits a ceiling and then crashes. That's how it works, that's how it has always worked.

We've hit that ceiling, and we've hit the decline. Now we sit on the edge of the cliff. We will fall, make no doubt, but we don't have to fall as hard if we work together. We can save a semblance of civilized life for ourselves and our children.

Coming together is the answer, and we all know it. Let's just hope the right questions reach enough of us in time.

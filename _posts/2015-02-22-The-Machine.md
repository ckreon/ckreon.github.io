title: The Machine

The machine is designed to provoke and consume energy.

"A worthy cause," it may seem.

The machine is enormous, drowning out everything with its power. Sometimes, from behind the machine, shadowy flickers emerge, but never long enough to be truly glimpsed.

Old tales offer stories of this machine, of the shadows, and even of things beyond.

"With concentration, and with persistence, a deeper glimpse can be had," they say. "A glimpse behind even the shadows."

It is, perhaps, the source enabling such shadows in the first place. A single point of light. A point burning with truth.

The shadows interrupt the light most of the time, bending and mutating it - changing how it is cast. But with patience, a rare glimpse can be caught of the light uninterrupted, unaltered, and undivided. A sight so profound and changing that few even believe it is possible. Such exposure is said to dissolve the illusions of the machine, and more importantly, those who operate it.

In rare cases, with such a glimpse, one might be able to realize the entire machine is an illusion of these shadows, and thus its operators too.

And with true wisdom, one may have the greatest revelation of all - realizing himself as the shadow-master.

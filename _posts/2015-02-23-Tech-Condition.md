title: The Technological Condition
---

Technology like Augmented Reality is potentially the biggest change we have ever experienced as a species. It has the power to turn the world around us into an interactive technological experience, or completely reanimate it into something new. But what does such technology mean for us as humans, and is it good? What has technology done for us already?

We seem to live in a world of numbers. There are statistics, algorithms, and probabilities guiding our every move. These numbers make the technological condition possible, and as we march down the path of advancement, we accept every risk associated with their gains. After all, with any tool comes the ability to do good or evil. However, it is difficult to qualify the moral attributes of technology, as it is difficult to qualify morality in the first place. When one assumes pros and cons, a split of emotion, rationale, and logic emerges that seems to endlessly conflict.

In such cases, the gut-instinct is philosophically the trusted message, simply because it holds no expectations. A glimpse around the world shows us what our current understanding of numbers is actually manifesting. We try and educate ourselves on this, but we do so with more numbers. We do not actually learn what those numbers mean.

When a person hears that, according to FAO, there are almost one billion starving people on the planet, the brain does not process that correctly. The person will know to act appalled or sad, but will never understand the full implications of such numbers. We will call this thought compression, because we are taking inordinately huge volumes of information, feelings, and experiences, and compressing them into something that can be shared in a few words.

Hunger statistics are hardly the point, however. Once the process of thought compression is brought to light, it shows up everywhere. Our lives and beliefs are based on compressed understandings of the past as we are told it. Civilizations, wars, economy - we compress all of this into tidy facts.

Some of this compression is needed and of benefit. But one does stumble upon the question of how much data are we supposed to hold, and how much of that data should be useable information. Should one be holding the compressed lives of all their Facebook friends in their mind?

This brings us to our current technological condition. Our brains are full of these numbers, but we do not understand their true significance. We have been blinded. We have entire education systems set up to redundantly dispense the same facts. We have a minimum twelve years of schooling. Twelve years (that is a significant amount of time compressed into two words). In step with the system of redundancy of the whole system, most of that time is spent doing the same thing ad nauseum. There is no wisdom or creativity; there are only rules and facts. We have a field called management dedicated solely to the study of getting people to do things they do not want to do.

Once we finish twelve to twenty years of school, we sell insurance to each other. All of that knowledge beaten into us, and yet we are still completely dependent on the technological system.

Is this truly where we thought the path would lead us? Is this the peak of our civilization? Have our numbers given back to us what we have given to them? While largely irrelevant in a logical sense, these questions help to start decompressing our thoughts into something we can actually feel. Our current state feels wrong, and it is with that feeling that we can start to understand the implications of technology on humanity.

We have stood on the shoulders of our past for long enough. It is time to hear our inner feelings and stop denying our situation. Things are not good, no matter how the numbers are dressed. The emperor has no clothes.

Technology is not to blame, however. It is only our use of it. Most of us drive cars that were built from resources scourged out of the planet. These same cars are filled with gas produced by wars and genocide. The toxic emissions kill us and the life around us. We seem to know this on a certain level, but again we do not understand the full transgression in an accurate way. We need to stop looking at our world through technology. We need to understand the implications of technology, and what we are truly doing to ourselves. What happens when we have typed on keyboards for so long that we no longer know how to write? Is that bad?

With Augmented Reality on the cusp of mainstream, such hypothetical questions are important things to consider. We are in the position of possibly never being able to look at life without technology. Dependence is always something to be measured carefully, and we are about to invest another huge sum of dependence into this. Will we have any left?
